# Snowfall React

This is a simple React component that creates a snowfall effect on your website. The snowflakes will fall and gradually fade out, creating a festive and wintery atmosphere. The snowfall effect is active only during a specific period (from December 17th to January 7th).

## Features

- üéÑ Snowflakes fall from the top of the screen with varying speeds and sizes.
- üå®Ô∏è Snowflakes gradually fade out as they fall.
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è Only visible from December 17th to January 7th, creating a seasonal effect.
- üéÖ Easy to integrate into any React project.
- üßë‚Äçüíª Written in React, with custom CSS for the snowfall animation.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snowfall-react.git
cd snowfall-react
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Install the required dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Usage

You can use the `SnowFall` component in your React app like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import SnowFall from './path/to/SnowFall'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <SnowFall />
      {/* Your app content here */}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

The `SnowFall` component automatically checks whether the current date is within the snowing period (December 17th to January 7th) and shows the snowflakes accordingly. If it is not within that period, no snowflakes will be displayed.

### 4. Customization

You can customize the snowfall effect in the `SnowStyles` component:

- Adjust the size and speed of the snowflakes by changing the `animationDuration` and `fontSize` properties.
- Modify the appearance of the snowflakes by changing the content (`‚ùÑ` character) or the CSS styling.

```css
.sf-snow-flake {
  font-size: 20px; /* Snowflake size */
  animation-duration: 10s; /* Snowflake fall speed */
}
```

### 5. Example

Here is an example of the component being used in a simple React app:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import SnowFall from './components/SnowFall'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SnowFall />
      <h1>Welcome to Winter Wonderland!</h1>
      <p>Enjoy the snowfall effect during the winter season!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

## How It Works

The `SnowFall` component creates snowflakes that fall from the top of the screen using a CSS `@keyframes` animation. The snowflakes are created at random horizontal positions and given random animation durations and sizes.

1. **Snowflakes Creation:** Snowflakes are created at an interval of 200 milliseconds.
2. **Snowflakes Fade:** After 20 seconds, snowflakes stop being created, and those already on screen will start to fade out as they fall.
3. **Period Control:** Snowflakes are only shown between December 17th and January 7th, making the effect seasonal.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: To create the snowfall effect using `@keyframes` animations.
- **JavaScript**: For controlling the behavior and logic of the snowflakes.
